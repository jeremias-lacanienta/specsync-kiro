# SpecSync Video Presentation Script

## Opening (0:00-0:30)
**[Screen: Kiro IDE with empty workspace]**

"Hi! I'm going to show you how I built SpecSync - an AI-powered specification review meeting room - using Kiro's full feature set. What makes this special is that I used all three of Kiro's key capabilities: building from scratch, agent hooks, and spec-driven development."

## Part 1: Building and Vibe Coding from Scratch (0:30-2:00)

**[Screen: Show initial conversation with Kiro]**

"Let me start with how I structured my conversations with Kiro to build this project from scratch.

**My conversation approach was iterative and collaborative:**
- I started with a simple concept: 'I want to build an AI-powered specification review meeting room'
- Kiro helped me break this down into components: React frontend, Node.js backend, WebSocket real-time collaboration
- I used natural language throughout: 'Make this work in Kiro's webview' or 'This needs to work across different projects'

**[Screen: Show the most impressive code generation - the WebSocket real-time collaboration system]**

The most impressive code generation was when Kiro created the entire real-time collaboration system. I simply said 'I need real-time collaboration where team members can annotate spec lines and see each other's comments instantly.'

**[Show server/index.js WebSocket code]**

Kiro generated:
- Complete WebSocket server with Socket.IO
- Real-time annotation system
- Meeting state management
- AI facilitation triggers
- Database integration with SQLite

This was 296 lines of production-ready code that handled complex real-time state synchronization - something that would typically take hours to implement manually."

## Part 2: Agent Hooks (2:00-3:30)

**[Screen: Show .kiro/hooks directory]**

"Next, let's talk about the agent hooks I created to automate key workflows.

**I automated three specific workflows:**

**[Screen: Show .kiro/hooks/pre-meeting-analysis.md]**

1. **Pre-meeting Analysis Hook** - Automatically analyzes uploaded specs for common issues like ambiguous language, missing acceptance criteria, and vague requirements

**[Screen: Show .kiro/hooks/real-time-facilitation.md]**

2. **Real-time Facilitation Hook** - Monitors meeting discussions and provides contextual AI guidance to keep conversations productive

**[Screen: Show .kiro/hooks/post-meeting-summary.md]**

3. **Post-meeting Summary Hook** - Automatically generates comprehensive summaries with action items and refined specifications when meetings end

**How these hooks improved my development process:**
- **Reduced manual work** - No need to manually analyze specs or generate summaries
- **Consistent quality** - Automated analysis catches issues I might miss
- **Better user experience** - Real-time AI facilitation keeps meetings focused
- **Faster iteration** - Automated summaries speed up the feedback loop

**[Screen: Show hook execution in action]**

The hooks integrate seamlessly - when a user uploads a spec, analysis happens automatically. During meetings, facilitation suggestions appear contextually. After meetings, summaries generate without any manual intervention."

## Part 3: Spec-to-Code Implementation (3:30-5:00)

**[Screen: Show .kiro/specs directory structure]**

"Finally, let me show you how I used Kiro's spec-driven development approach.

**[Screen: Show .kiro/specs/specsync-core.md]**

I structured my specs hierarchically:
- **Core specification** defining the overall system architecture
- **Feature specifications** for individual components like real-time collaboration
- **Integration specifications** for Kiro webview integration

**[Screen: Show requirements and acceptance criteria]**

Each spec included:
- Clear user stories: 'As a developer, I want to review specs collaboratively...'
- Specific acceptance criteria: 'WHEN a user adds an annotation THEN all participants SHALL see it in real-time'
- Technical requirements: WebSocket integration, database schema, API endpoints

**[Screen: Show .kiro/specs/specsync-kiro-webview-integration/]**

The most complex example was the Kiro webview integration spec. I defined:
- Requirements for native webview panels
- Cross-project compatibility needs  
- Automatic server management
- Error handling and fallbacks

**[Screen: Show Kiro generating code from specs]**

Then I simply told Kiro: 'Implement the webview integration spec' and it generated:
- Complete TypeScript extension code
- WebView provider classes
- Server management logic
- Error handling and user feedback

**How spec-driven development improved my process:**
- **Clear direction** - Specs provided a roadmap for implementation
- **Better collaboration** - Specs served as documentation for the AI
- **Quality assurance** - Acceptance criteria ensured complete implementation
- **Easier iteration** - Changes to specs automatically guided code updates"

## Part 4: Integration and Results (5:00-6:00)

**[Screen: Show final working SpecSync application]**

"The result is SpecSync - a fully functional AI-powered specification review system that:

**[Screen: Show SpecSync running in Kiro webview]**

- Runs natively in Kiro's webview (no external browser needed)
- Works across different projects without setup
- Provides real-time collaboration with AI facilitation
- Automatically analyzes specs and generates meeting summaries

**[Screen: Show steering integration]**

The best part? It's integrated with Kiro's steering system, so I can just say 'Launch SpecSync' and everything happens automatically.

**[Screen: Show global installation at ~/.kiro/specsync/]**

And because I built it with cross-project compatibility in mind, it works in any Kiro workspace through the global installation - install once, use everywhere."

## Closing (6:00-6:30)

**[Screen: Show project structure and key files]**

"What impressed me most about building with Kiro was how all three approaches - building from scratch, agent hooks, and spec-driven development - worked together seamlessly. 

The specs guided the implementation, the hooks automated the workflows, and Kiro's conversational coding made the whole process feel natural and collaborative.

SpecSync isn't just a tool I built - it's a demonstration of how AI-assisted development can transform complex projects into manageable, iterative conversations.

Thanks for watching!"

## Key Talking Points to Emphasize:

### Building from Scratch:
- **Conversational approach**: Natural language requests that Kiro understood contextually
- **Iterative development**: Building complexity gradually through conversation
- **Most impressive generation**: 300+ lines of WebSocket real-time collaboration code

### Agent Hooks:
- **Three automated workflows**: Pre-analysis, real-time facilitation, post-meeting summaries
- **Development process improvement**: Reduced manual work, consistent quality, better UX
- **Seamless integration**: Hooks work automatically without user intervention

### Spec-to-Code:
- **Hierarchical structure**: Core → Features → Integration specs
- **Clear requirements**: User stories, acceptance criteria, technical specs
- **Implementation guidance**: Specs provided roadmap for AI code generation
- **Quality assurance**: Acceptance criteria ensured complete implementation

### Overall Impact:
- **Synergistic approach**: All three methods worked together
- **Production-ready result**: Fully functional cross-project tool
- **Natural development flow**: Felt like collaborating with an intelligent partner
