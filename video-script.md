# SpecSync - 3 Minute DevPost Video Script

## Opening (0:00-0:20)
**[Screen: SpecSync running in Kiro webview]**

"Hi! I built SpecSync - an AI-powered specification review meeting room - using all three of Kiro's key capabilities: conversational coding from scratch, agent hooks, and spec-driven development. Let me show you how Kiro transformed my development process."

## Part 1: Conversational Coding from Scratch (0:20-1:10)

**[Screen: Show server/index.js WebSocket code]**

"I structured my conversations with Kiro iteratively. I started with: 'I want to build an AI-powered specification review meeting room.' Kiro broke this into components: React frontend, Node.js backend, WebSocket collaboration.

**[Highlight WebSocket code sections]**

The most impressive generation was the real-time collaboration system. I simply said 'I need real-time collaboration where team members can annotate spec lines instantly.' Kiro generated 296 lines of production-ready WebSocket code with Socket.IO, real-time annotations, meeting state management, and AI facilitation triggers.

This complex real-time synchronization would typically take hours to implement manually."

## Part 2: Agent Hooks (1:10-1:50)

**[Screen: Show .kiro/hooks directory with 3 files]**

"I automated three key workflows with agent hooks:

**[Quick show of each file]**

1. **Pre-meeting Analysis** - Automatically analyzes specs for ambiguous language and missing requirements
2. **Real-time Facilitation** - Provides contextual AI guidance during meetings  
3. **Post-meeting Summary** - Generates comprehensive summaries with action items

**[Screen: Show hooks in action - maybe steering integration]**

These hooks improved my development process by reducing manual work, ensuring consistent quality, and creating seamless automation. When users upload specs, analysis happens automatically. During meetings, AI facilitation appears contextually. After meetings, summaries generate without intervention."

## Part 3: Spec-to-Code Development (1:50-2:40)

**[Screen: Show .kiro/specs directory - specsync-core.md and webview integration folder]**

"I structured my specs hierarchically: core system architecture, feature specifications, and integration specs.

**[Screen: Show requirements with user stories and acceptance criteria]**

Each spec included clear user stories like 'As a developer, I want to review specs collaboratively' and specific acceptance criteria: 'WHEN a user adds an annotation THEN all participants SHALL see it in real-time.'

**[Screen: Show .kiro/specs/specsync-kiro-webview-integration/requirements.md]**

The most complex was the Kiro webview integration spec. I defined requirements for native webview panels, cross-project compatibility, and automatic server management.

**[Screen: Show the actual working webview integration]**

Then I told Kiro: 'Implement the webview integration spec' and it generated complete TypeScript extension code, WebView providers, and server management logic.

Spec-driven development provided clear direction, better AI collaboration, and quality assurance through acceptance criteria."

## Closing: Results and Impact (2:40-3:00)

**[Screen: Show SpecSync running in Kiro webview with steering integration]**

"The result is SpecSync - a fully functional AI-powered specification review system that runs natively in Kiro's webview, works across projects without setup, and provides real-time collaboration with AI facilitation.

**[Screen: Show .kiro directory structure]**

What impressed me most was how all three Kiro approaches worked together seamlessly. The specs guided implementation, hooks automated workflows, and conversational coding made complex development feel natural and collaborative.

SpecSync demonstrates how AI-assisted development transforms complex projects into manageable, iterative conversations. Thanks for watching!"

## Key Talking Points to Emphasize:

### Building from Scratch:
- **Conversational approach**: Natural language requests that Kiro understood contextually
- **Iterative development**: Building complexity gradually through conversation
- **Most impressive generation**: 300+ lines of WebSocket real-time collaboration code

### Agent Hooks:
- **Three automated workflows**: Pre-analysis, real-time facilitation, post-meeting summaries
- **Development process improvement**: Reduced manual work, consistent quality, better UX
- **Seamless integration**: Hooks work automatically without user intervention

### Spec-to-Code:
- **Hierarchical structure**: Core → Features → Integration specs
- **Clear requirements**: User stories, acceptance criteria, technical specs
- **Implementation guidance**: Specs provided roadmap for AI code generation
- **Quality assurance**: Acceptance criteria ensured complete implementation

### Overall Impact:
- **Synergistic approach**: All three methods worked together
- **Production-ready result**: Fully functional cross-project tool
- **Natural development flow**: Felt like collaborating with an intelligent partner
