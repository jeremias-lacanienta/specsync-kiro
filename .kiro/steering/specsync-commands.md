# SpecSync Global Integration

When the user asks to launch SpecSync, use the global installation:

```bash
./specsync
```

This will:
- ✅ Start SpecSync from global installation (~/.kiro/specsync)
- ✅ Work in ANY Kiro project without setup
- ✅ Open webview file automatically
- ✅ Provide consistent cross-project experience

Tell user: "SpecSync is starting globally. Open ~/.kiro/specsync/specsync-webview.html with 'Live Preview' in Kiro to view SpecSync."
