# SpecSync Core Application Specification

## Overview
Build a real-time collaborative specification review platform that uses AI to facilitate productive meetings and generate actionable outcomes.

## Core Features

### 1. Meeting Creation & Management
**Requirements:**
- Users can create new meetings with title and spec content
- System generates unique meeting IDs for sharing
- Pre-meeting analysis identifies spec issues and discussion points
- Support for joining existing meetings via ID

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Meeting creation form validates required fields
- Spec analysis completes within 3 seconds
- Meeting IDs are shareable and persistent
- Error handling for invalid meeting IDs

### 2. Real-time Collaboration
**Requirements:**
- Multiple participants can join simultaneously
- Live cursor tracking and participant awareness
- Real-time annotation system with line-level comments
- Instant synchronization across all connected clients

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WebSocket connections handle 10+ concurrent users
- Annotations appear immediately for all participants
- Connection drops are handled gracefully with reconnection
- No data loss during network interruptions

### 3. AI-Powered Facilitation
**Requirements:**
- Kiro analyzes specs for ambiguities and gaps
- Real-time suggestions based on discussion context
- Automated discussion point generation
- Intelligent meeting flow guidance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Analysis identifies common spec issues (should vs must, missing roles)
- Suggestions are contextually relevant and helpful
- AI interventions feel natural, not intrusive
- Facilitation improves meeting productivity measurably

### 4. Meeting Outcomes
**Requirements:**
- Automated summary generation at meeting end
- Action item extraction from discussions
- Refined specification output
- Integration points for follow-up workflows

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Summaries capture key decisions and next steps
- Action items are specific and assignable
- Refined specs are implementation-ready
- Export formats support common tools (Markdown, JSON)

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React)
- Material-UI for consistent design system
- Socket.io-client for real-time communication
- Axios for HTTP API calls
- Local state management with React hooks

### Backend (Node.js)
- Express.js web server
- Socket.io for WebSocket handling
- SQLite database for persistence
- UUID generation for unique identifiers

### Database Schema
```sql
meetings: id, title, spec_content, analysis, status, timestamps
participants: id, meeting_id, name, role, joined_at
annotations: id, meeting_id, participant_id, content, line_number, timestamp
```

### WebSocket Events
- Connection: `join-meeting`, `participant-joined/left`
- Collaboration: `add-annotation`, `new-annotation`
- AI: `kiro-suggestion`, `analysis-complete`
- Lifecycle: `end-meeting`, `meeting-ended`

## AI Integration Points

### Spec Analysis Engine
- Parse specification content for structure and clarity
- Identify ambiguous language patterns
- Flag missing requirements categories
- Generate targeted discussion questions

### Real-time Facilitation
- Monitor annotation patterns for engagement
- Suggest clarifying questions when needed
- Redirect off-topic discussions gently
- Provide context-aware meeting guidance

### Summary Generation
- Extract key decisions from annotations
- Identify action items and owners
- Generate refined specification text
- Create follow-up task recommendations

## Success Metrics
- Meeting completion rate > 90%
- Participant satisfaction score > 4.0/5.0
- Spec clarity improvement (before/after analysis)
- Time to implementation reduction
- Reduced back-and-forth in follow-up discussions
