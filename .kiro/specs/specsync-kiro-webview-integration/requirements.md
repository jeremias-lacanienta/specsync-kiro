# SpecSync Kiro Webview Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for integrating SpecSync directly into Kiro's webview system, eliminating the need for external browsers and providing seamless cross-project functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic Kiro Webview Launch

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro, I want SpecSync to automatically open in a Kiro webview panel when I request it, so that I don't need to use external browsers or perform manual steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I say "Launch SpecSync" in any Kiro workspace THEN SpecSync SHALL automatically open in a Kiro webview panel
2. WHEN the webview opens THEN it SHALL display the full SpecSync interface at localhost:3000
3. WHEN the SpecSync server is not running THEN it SHALL start automatically before opening the webview
4. WHEN the webview is created THEN it SHALL be properly sized and integrated into Kiro's interface

### Requirement 2: Cross-Project Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer working on multiple projects, I want SpecSync to be available in any Kiro workspace without project-specific setup, so that I can use it consistently across all my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch to a new Kiro project THEN SpecSync SHALL be available without additional configuration
2. WHEN I run "Launch SpecSync" in different projects THEN it SHALL work identically in each project
3. WHEN SpecSync launches THEN it SHALL not require project-specific files or dependencies
4. WHEN using SpecSync across projects THEN it SHALL maintain consistent behavior and interface

### Requirement 3: Single Command Operation

**User Story:** As a user, I want one simple voice command or action that handles all SpecSync setup and launching automatically, so that I can focus on specification review rather than technical setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request SpecSync THEN it SHALL require only one command: "Launch SpecSync"
2. WHEN the command executes THEN it SHALL handle server startup, webview creation, and interface loading automatically
3. WHEN there are technical issues THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions
4. WHEN the process completes THEN it SHALL confirm successful launch with visual feedback

### Requirement 4: Kiro Native Integration

**User Story:** As a Kiro user, I want SpecSync to feel like a native part of Kiro rather than an external tool, so that it integrates seamlessly with my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SpecSync opens THEN it SHALL use Kiro's native webview panel system
2. WHEN the webview is active THEN it SHALL support Kiro's standard panel operations (resize, dock, close)
3. WHEN SpecSync is running THEN it SHALL appear in Kiro's panel management system
4. WHEN I close the webview THEN it SHALL properly clean up resources and allow relaunching

### Requirement 5: Automatic Resource Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want SpecSync to automatically manage its server and resources, so that I don't need to manually start/stop services or worry about port conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SpecSync launches THEN it SHALL automatically detect if the server is already running
2. WHEN the server is not running THEN it SHALL start the server automatically
3. WHEN there are port conflicts THEN it SHALL either use the existing server or find an alternative port
4. WHEN SpecSync closes THEN it SHALL optionally clean up server resources based on user preference

## Success Criteria

- User can launch SpecSync with a single voice command in any Kiro project
- SpecSync opens automatically in Kiro's webview without external browser windows
- The integration works consistently across different projects and workspaces
- The user experience feels native to Kiro rather than like an external tool
- No manual setup or configuration is required for new projects
