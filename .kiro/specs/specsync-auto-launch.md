# SpecSync Auto-Launch Feature

## Overview
Create an automatic launch system for SpecSync that works across different Kiro projects without manual intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Cross-Project Compatibility
**User Story:** As a developer working on multiple projects, I want SpecSync to be available in any Kiro workspace without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I say "Launch SpecSync" in any Kiro project THEN SpecSync SHALL start automatically
2. WHEN SpecSync launches THEN it SHALL open in Kiro's webview panel automatically
3. WHEN switching between projects THEN SpecSync SHALL be available without reconfiguration

### Requirement 2: Automatic Webview Integration
**User Story:** As a user, I want SpecSync to open directly in Kiro without external browser windows.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN SpecSync launches THEN it SHALL create a webview panel in Kiro
2. WHEN the webview opens THEN it SHALL load SpecSync at localhost:3000
3. WHEN the server is not running THEN it SHALL start automatically before opening webview

### Requirement 3: Single Command Operation
**User Story:** As a user, I want one simple command that handles everything automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I request SpecSync THEN it SHALL require only one command or request
2. WHEN the command runs THEN it SHALL handle server startup, webview creation, and opening automatically
3. WHEN there are errors THEN it SHALL provide clear feedback and recovery options

## Technical Requirements
- Must work across different Kiro workspaces
- Must integrate with Kiro's webview system
- Must handle server lifecycle automatically
- Must provide consistent experience regardless of project
