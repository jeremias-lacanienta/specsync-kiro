# Devpost Submission Form - Spec Review Meeting Room

## Project name*
SpecSync

## Elevator pitch*
Transform vague requirements into crystal-clear specs through AI-facilitated team collaboration and structured review sessions.

## About the project*
### Inspiration
Every developer has been there - implementing features based on unclear specs, only to discover misaligned expectations during code review. Traditional spec reviews are often unstructured, miss critical edge cases, and leave teams with more questions than answers. We wanted to create a tool that transforms spec review from a chaotic discussion into a structured, productive process that sets teams up for implementation success.

### What it does
SpecSync is an AI-powered meeting room specifically designed for specification reviews. Before meetings, Kiro analyzes specs to identify gaps, ambiguities, and missing requirements. During the session, Kiro acts as an intelligent facilitator, suggesting discussion points, asking clarifying questions, and keeping conversations focused. After the meeting, it generates a refined, implementation-ready specification with clear acceptance criteria and technical requirements.

Key features:
- Pre-meeting spec analysis with gap identification
- Real-time AI facilitation during review sessions
- Collaborative annotation and discussion threading
- Automated generation of refined specs and action items
- Seamless integration with Kiro's spec-to-code workflow

### How we built it
Built using Kiro's full feature set:
- **Specs**: Structured the meeting flow and review process using Kiro's spec-driven development
- **Agent Hooks**: Automated pre-meeting analysis, post-meeting summaries, and action item creation
- **Conversational AI**: Kiro serves as the meeting facilitator, analyzing discussions in real-time
- **Multi-modal Chat**: Supports various input types for comprehensive spec review

Technology stack: React, Node.js, WebSocket, Express.js, SQLite

### Challenges we ran into
- Balancing AI guidance with human creativity in spec discussions
- Creating an intuitive interface for real-time collaborative editing
- Ensuring Kiro's suggestions enhance rather than interrupt natural conversation flow
- Integrating multiple Kiro features seamlessly within the meeting experience

### What we learned
- The importance of structured processes in team collaboration
- How AI can serve as an intelligent facilitator rather than just a code generator
- The value of addressing upstream problems (specs) rather than downstream fixes (code reviews)
- Kiro's potential extends far beyond individual coding assistance

### What's next for SpecSync
- Integration with popular project management tools (Jira, Linear, etc.)
- Support for different spec formats (user stories, technical requirements, API specs)
- Advanced analytics on spec quality and team alignment metrics
- Mobile app for on-the-go spec reviews and approvals

## Built with*
- Kiro AI IDE
- React
- Node.js
- WebSocket
- Express.js
- SQLite
- JavaScript/TypeScript

## How was Kiro used in your project?*

### Spec-to-Code Approach
We structured our development around Kiro's spec-driven workflow, creating detailed specifications for each component of SpecSync before implementation:

**Main Application Spec Structure:**
- Created a comprehensive spec outlining the meeting room interface, real-time collaboration features, and AI facilitation logic
- Broke down complex features into smaller, implementable specs (user authentication, WebSocket connections, spec analysis engine)
- Used Kiro's conversational interface to refine requirements and edge cases before coding

**How the spec-driven approach improved our development:**
- **Clarity**: Kiro helped identify ambiguous requirements early, preventing implementation confusion
- **Architecture**: The AI suggested better component separation and data flow patterns during spec discussions
- **Testing**: Specs naturally led to clear acceptance criteria, making testing more straightforward
- **Iteration**: When requirements changed, updating specs first allowed Kiro to suggest minimal code changes

### Agent Hooks Implementation
We automated key workflows using Kiro's agent hooks:

**Pre-meeting Analysis Hook:**
- Triggered when new specs are uploaded to the system
- Automatically analyzes specifications for gaps, ambiguities, and missing requirements
- Generates discussion points and suggested questions for the review meeting

**Post-meeting Summary Hook:**
- Activated when meeting sessions end
- Processes meeting transcripts and annotations
- Generates refined specifications and action items
- Creates follow-up tasks and assigns them to team members

**Real-time Facilitation Hook:**
- Monitors ongoing discussions during meetings
- Suggests relevant questions when conversations stagnate
- Identifies when topics drift off-track and gently redirects

**How hooks improved our development process:**
- **Automation**: Eliminated manual prep work and follow-up tasks
- **Consistency**: Ensured every spec review followed the same structured process
- **Intelligence**: AI-powered insights improved meeting quality without human intervention
- **Integration**: Seamless handoff between meeting outcomes and implementation tasks

### Building and Vibe Coding
**Conversation Structure with Kiro:**
1. **Initial Brainstorming**: Used natural language to explore the concept and refine the core value proposition
2. **Architecture Planning**: Discussed system design, component relationships, and data flow patterns
3. **Feature Implementation**: Iterative conversations for each major feature, with Kiro suggesting improvements and catching edge cases
4. **Integration Challenges**: Collaborative problem-solving when connecting different system components

**Most Impressive Code Generation:**
Kiro generated the entire real-time WebSocket message handling system, including:
- Complex state synchronization logic for multiple concurrent users
- Automatic conflict resolution for simultaneous spec edits
- Intelligent message queuing and delivery confirmation
- Error handling and reconnection logic

The generated code was production-ready and handled edge cases we hadn't even considered, like handling network interruptions during critical meeting moments and ensuring data consistency across all connected clients.
